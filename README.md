# e-commerce-Website
The end goal of this project is to implement a full-stack web application that follows a e-commerce web applications.
As of 12/07/2023 -- I added another page which is the book.html, it gets a list of books that mocks an API, and use it to diplay onto the frontend. In this page, you have the ability to sort the list of books by either the highest price to the lowest price, vice versa, and sort by the ratings of each book.

- [ ] implement a add to chart function
